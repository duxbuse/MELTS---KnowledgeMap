MELTS---KnowledgeMap
====================

Abstract:
“In the modern higher education context, universities no longer educate only highly performing students, studying by personal choice and driven by the pursuit of academic excellence. Today‘s student population is much more diverse with increasingly non-academic motivations. Particularly for, but not limited to, early career academics, there is a need for simple, intuitive tools that can be easily integrated within existing units to increase student engagement with instructors and course material.”
